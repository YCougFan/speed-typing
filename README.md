Homework assignment from Brad to improve the game (i.e. High Score stored in local storage, fetch random words from an API,
user selects difficulty, etc)

My plan is to Reactify it (lol, make React components out of it). Also plan on fetching some sort of word API to give
it more options

Cool tutorial where I learned several different javascript functions to that make this app work.
